As with all non cosmetic mods and as a warning **do not** do anything online such as community challenges or the daily challenge with modded content. Getting an unfair advantage and setting a high score will surely get you banned.

## Usage

Once installed via thunderstore or manually. The file to edit is `json/settings.json`. The default values are those used within the game. Edit to your liking.

If installed via thunderstore the file you are looking for should be located at
`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Thunderstore Mod Manager\DataFolder\MonsterTrain2\profiles\<profile>\BepInEx\plugins\Balance-Configurator\json\settings.json`

If installed manually it should be placed where you installed BepinEx. Normally such an install would be placed in the same directory as the game's executable.
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Monster Train 2\BepInEx\plugins\Balance-Configurator\json\settings.json`
